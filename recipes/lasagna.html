    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a labor of love, often associated with family gatherings and special occasions. Each layer of the dish contributes to its unique taste and texture. The pasta sheets are tender yet slightly chewy, providing a sturdy base for the hearty fillings. The meat or vegetable sauce is savory, seasoned with garlic, onions, herbs, and tomatoes, creating a delicious blend of flavors. The creamy béchamel sauce adds a velvety richness, while the melted cheese on top forms a golden, gooey crust that is irresistible. The beauty of lasagna lies in its versatility, as you can customize the fillings to suit your preferences.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the meat sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened. Add the minced garlic and ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until the beef is browned and cooked through. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, beef broth, dried basil, dried oregano, dried thyme, sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and the flavors meld together. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.</li>
        <li>Prepare the béchamel sauce: In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk continuously for about 1-2 minutes to form a roux. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook the sauce, stirring frequently, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. Add ground nutmeg, salt, and pepper to season.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a large baking dish. Place lasagna sheets over the sauce, making sure they cover the entire bottom. Add a layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce, and then a sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of pasta sheets topped with the remaining béchamel sauce and cheeses.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese on top is golden and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Let it rest: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <P>Serve the classic beef lasagna with a fresh green salad and some garlic bread for a complete and satisfying meal. Enjoy the layers of flavors and textures that make this dish an all-time favorite!</P>
