        <h1>Steamed Bao</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Steamed bao buns have a distinct appearance and texture that make them stand out. The buns are typically round or oval-shaped with a smooth, slightly shiny surface. When properly steamed, they are light and airy, with a tender, pillowy texture that melts in your mouth. The top of the bao usually has a signature pleated pattern where the dough is gathered and twisted to seal in the filling.
        The fillings for steamed bao can vary widely, providing a range of savory and sweet options. Common savory fillings include char siu (Chinese BBQ pork), braised pork belly, minced chicken, beef, or vegetables like mushrooms and cabbage. For those with a sweet tooth, there are sweet bao filled with red bean paste, lotus seed paste, or custard.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water and sprinkle the yeast over it. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes or until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>Prepare the dough: In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and baking powder. Slowly add the yeast mixture and vegetable oil into the flour. Mix everything together until a dough forms.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough: Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Proof the dough: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours or until the dough doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Prepare the fillings: While the dough is proofing, prepare your desired filling. Cook and season the filling according to your chosen recipe.</li>
            <li>Shape the buns: Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into equal-sized pieces, usually about 12-16 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and then flatten it into a circle with your palm or a rolling pin. Leave the edges slightly thicker than the center.</li>
            <li>Fill and seal the buns: Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle. Pleat the edges together and twist to seal the bun. Make sure the bun is tightly sealed to prevent the filling from leaking during steaming.</li>
            <li>Let the buns rest: Place the filled buns on individual squares of parchment paper and let them rest for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Steam the buns: Set up a steamer basket lined with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Steam the buns in batches for about 12-15 minutes or until they become fluffy and fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy: Once steamed, remove the buns from the steamer and serve them hot. You can enjoy the steamed bao buns as a delightful snack or a satisfying meal</li>
        </ol>
